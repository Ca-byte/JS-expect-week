### FAQ
- browser sync is throwing errors on Windows and never boots:
  - Solution: Replace browser sync with http server.
    1. install **http-server** with `npm i -D http-server`
    2. in package.json, delete all `browser-sync` commands and replace them with `npx http-server .`
    3. Now the project will be running on :8080 so go to the browser and try accessing http://localhost:8080/
  The only thing is that the project won't restart when you change some code, you have to press F5 on the page every time you change something
